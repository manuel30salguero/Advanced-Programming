Make a Class
------------

Q1. Whatâ€™s const-correctness and why is it important?
A1. Const-correctness ensures that methods in a class do not modify the object state when they are not    
    supposed to. It helps prevent unintended side effects and improves code safety.

Q2. Is your class const-correct? How do you know?
A2. It is const-correct because the public methods that do read the private attributes of the class,
    do not modify them. That is, the private attributes are kept as read-only.
